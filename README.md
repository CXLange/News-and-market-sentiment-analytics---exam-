# News-and-market-sentiment-analytics---exam-
This repository was made for the exam in News and market sentiment analytics.

For the exam I have chosen source C.


## C. Fake and real news
Data from news media: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-
news-dataset. 
The dataset consists of two CSV files, True.csv and Fake.csv, which signifies real and fake news.

You are hired by a risk and media analytics team in a large investment firm. They want to
understand how misinformation differs from real news in **tone**, **style** and **topics** – and how
that might distort sentiment-based trading or reputation risk models.

# How I work

For this exam i have my 'working_notebook', where i write and test code, often quite messy, before deciding which parts to keep and then implement these in a cleaner workbook called 'main' which should be considered as the handed in code.
